# Design-and-Fabrication-Of-Water-Management-System

Integrated IoT and AI for Real-Time Monitoring:  
I designed a smart water management system using an ESP32 microcontroller combined with ultrasonic sensors for water level monitoring and a solenoid valve for precise flow control. The system utilized AI for data analysis, providing actionable insights and optimizing operations. Using the Blynk IoT platform, I integrated remote monitoring, enhancing system efficiency and user interaction by enabling users to track water levels and flow remotely.

Advanced Leak Detection and Water Conservation:
The system incorporated ultrasonic sensors for accurate real-time data collection and leak detection, which helped minimize water wastage. Additionally, I implemented a 12V DC relay to regulate water flow precisely. These measures contributed to achieving high efficiency ratios, significantly reducing water loss and improving overall system performance.

Sustainable and Efficient Water Management:  
The IoT-based water management system achieved impressive results, with 97.5% leakage detection accuracy and a 98.4% reduction in non-revenue water. These outcomes greatly improved water conservation efforts, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating IoT and AI for sustainable water management. The system not only contributed to better water resource management but also highlighted the potential for implementing smart technologies in solving real-world environmental challenges.
