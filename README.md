# Design-and-Fabrication-Of-Water-Management-System
I developed a smart water management system using an ESP32 microcontroller and ultrasonic sensors for leak detection and flow control. Integrated with AI and the Blynk IoT platform, the system achieved 97.5% leak detection and a 98.4% reduction in non-revenue water, improving water conservation.
